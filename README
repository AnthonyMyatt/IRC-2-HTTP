| IRC-2-HTTP is made up of two components; the c++ proxy   |
| and the javascript(ajax) client. The proxy maintains the |
| connection to the IRC server and is polled by the client |
| at a regular interval for new information. This means    |
| that an IRC session can be emulated in a web browser.    |

| 4. Installation                                          |
|                                                          |
|    a) Proxy                                              |
|                                                          |
| i.   cd into the socket directory                        |
| ii.  run make                                            |
| iii. run make install                                    |
|                                                          |
|    b) Client                                             |
|                                                          |
| i. copy the contents of the client directory your web    |
|    servers public_html directory and make sure the files |
|    have the needed permissions.                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| 5. Configuration                                         |
|                                                          |
|    a) Proxy                                              |
|                                                          |
| The configuration file (irc2http.conf) has a few values  |
| that can be chaned; some of these must be changed before |
| irc2http will work.                                      |
|                                                          |
|    b) Client                                             |
|                                                          |
| Like the proxy there is a configuration file (config.js) |
| that has values that need to be changed before irc2http  |
| will work and others that can be adjusted if needed.     |
