| IRC-2-HTTP is made up of two components;                 |
|   Proxy: The server creates an IRC session for every     |
|          user connected to it. It will relay commands    |
|          it recognises to the IRC server, including the  |
|          raw command. It will also translate the         |
|          incoming messages it recognises to json         |
|          commands. The incoming messages that it doesn't |
|          recognise will be relayed to the client as raw  |
|          messages. (The server is single threaded)       |
|  Client: The client polls the server for new messages    |
|          and sends messages via json commands.           |

| 4. Installation                                          |
|                                                          |
|    a) Proxy                                              |
|                                                          |
| i.   cd into the socket directory                        |
| ii.  run make                                            |
| iii. run make install                                    |
|                                                          |
|    b) Client                                             |
|                                                          |
| i. copy the contents of the client directory to your web |
|    servers public_html directory and make sure the files |
|    have the required permissions.                        |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| 5. Configuration                                         |
|                                                          |
|    a) Proxy                                              |
|                                                          |
| The configuration file (irc2http.conf) has a few values  |
| that can be chaned; some of these must be changed before |
| irc2http will work.                                      |
|                                                          |
|    b) Client                                             |
|                                                          |
| Like the proxy there is a configuration file (config.js) |
| that has values that need to be changed before irc2http  |
| will work and others that can be adjusted if needed.     |
